<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a product made for the company IT-SIS. The goal is simple, create a module where we can estimate the distance between us and our client delivery address inside Odoo. We also needed to use an open-source and free solution to calculate the distance

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/)

Since Odoo is made in python, we used this language for our module.

OpenRouteServce let us calculate easily through their API the distance and time between two points.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Here are the differents steps to install and use this module.

### Prerequisites

For this module to work, you'll need to get an [OpenRouteService APIkey](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/home). It is free, open-source and you just need to create an account to use their service.

### Installation

To install this module into Odoo, follow thes steps.

1. Clone the repo inside your Odoo installation addons folder
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Noel-louis/odoo-trip-estimator
   ```
2. Install Python packages for openrouteservice
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Restart your odoo server and upgrade your module list
4. Enter your API in the parameter for the module

## Usage

This module is really simple and easy to use. it adds a button and 2 lines of information on _DELIVERY CONTACT_ only. if the api key is set properly, just press the button and wait a bit for the data to be received, you'll get an estimation of the time and distance between your company address (the one in the general parameter) and the delivery address.

Note that Every request result will be stored in Odoo database and used if possible instead of an API request.

Also, the number of API request is limited in quantity per day but should be more than enough for every use.
